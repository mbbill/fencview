1. INTRODUCTION                                         *FencviewIntroduction*
                                                                    *Fencview*

Have you ever met that after opening a text file with some kind of encoding
you got a bunch of unreadable mess?

If so, you need **fencview.vim**.

Normally, vim detects file encoding based on *fileencodings* option.

For example, if we set this option like this:
`set fileencodings=ucs-bom,GB2312,big5`

Firstly vim try to read file bom. If there is no bom, vim will try to decode
the file with GB2312. Unfortunately, the GB2312 and big5 have a lot of
overlapped code-points which could lead to a big5-encoded file be decoded with
GB2312 by mistake. Then you got mess.

The **fencview.vim** uses another approach, let me show you how.
As we know, take Chinese for example, the occurrence frequency of every
character in a normal article is different. For example, '的' is a high
frequency character which is encoded to 0xb5c4 in GB2312. However, in Big5
0xb5c4 is the code point for '腔' which is much less frequently used. So we
can "guess" the encoding of a file by count up the frequently used characters.
It is not 100% accurate but works in most cases.

The user manual is embeded in **fencview.vim**, refer to it if you'd like to
custmize this script.

If you encounter a file that **fencview.vim** can not handle, you're more than
welcome to send it to me in order to improve the algrithm, but take care of the
sensitive data before you do that.

2. INSTALLATION                                         *FencviewInstallation*

Simply put **[fencview.vim](https://github.com/mbbill/fencview/blob/master/plugin/fencview.vim)**
into *plugin* directory and that's all.

For windows users, you need to put **iconv.dll** ([download link](https://sites.google.com/site/mbbill/iconv.dll))
into one of your directory in %path%.

3. USAGE                                                       *FencviewUsage*

You don't have to do anything: it just works.

4. COMMANDS                                                 *FencviewCommands*

  :FencAutoDetect                                           *:FencAutoDetect*
      Auto detect the file encoding.
         Built-in detected encodings:
            Unicode:
               UTF-8
            Chinese Simplified:
               CP936 (GBK, EUC-CN)
            Chinese Traditional:
               CP950 (Big5)
               EUC-TW
            Japanese:
               CP932 (SJIS)
               EUC-JP
            Korean:
               CP949 (EUC-KR)

  :FencView                                                 *:FencView*
      Open the encoding list window,
      <up> and <down> to select an encoding,
      enter to reload the file

===============================================================================
5. CUSTOMISATION                                       *FencviewCustomisation*

Set these value in vimrc to config this
plugin. Example:
let g:fencview_autodetect = 1

"$FENCVIEW_TELLENC"
  Now FencView allows the use of an external
  program to determine the file encoding. It
  may give you better performance, or better
  accuracy, in some cases. Set the environment
  variable FENCVIEW_TELLENC (or the vimrc
  variable $FENCVIEW_TELLENC) to use this
  feature. It is currently tested against
  tellenc.
  (default: 'tellenc')
  It means if tellenc is executable, it will
  be used by default. If you still want to use
  the detection mechanism of this script, set
  the value to "fencview".

"g:fencview_autodetect"
  Auto detect file encoding when you open a
  file.
  (default: 0)

"g:fencview_auto_patterns"
  Set this variable in your vimrc to decide
  the pattern of file names to enable
  autodetection.
  (default: '*.txt,*.htm{l\=}')

"g:fencview_checklines"
  It checks first and last several lines of
  current file, so don't set the value too
  large. Set to 0 if you want to check every
  line." (default: 10)

6. Tips                                                           *FencviewTips*

a. "+iconv" feature is needed. If you are using Microsoft Windows, make sure
   you have iconv.dll in $PATH.  (http://mbbill.googlepages.com/iconv.dll)
   Use command ":echo has('iconv')" to check it.

b. Make sure there is no modeline at the end of current file.

c. Set encoding to utf-8 for better performance.

d. No effect to Vim encrypted files.
